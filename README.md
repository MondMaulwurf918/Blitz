# Blitz Compiler

⚡️ A super-simple, whitespace-insensitive, lightning-fast compiled language with a clean syntax and a minimal runtime.

## Design Principles

Blitz is designed with the following core values in mind:

- **Simplicity Over Features**: Focus on doing a few things extremely well rather than trying to do everything
- **Compilation Speed**: Blazingly fast compilation times to enhance developer experience
- **Executable Performance**: Generate efficient machine code that runs with minimal overhead
- **No GC, No Runtime**: Direct memory management without garbage collection overhead
- **No Whitespace Rules**: Code formatting that doesn't affect semantics
- **C-like, But Friendlier**: Familiar syntax for C/C++ developers with modern ergonomics

## Project Status

This project is in early development stages. See the [RoadMap.md](RoadMap.md) file for the detailed development plan.

## Getting Started

*Coming soon*

## Language Features (Planned)

- Functions with `fn` keyword
- `main()` entry point
- Return statements
- Integer literals and arithmetic
- `let` variable declarations
- Basic type system starting with integer types (`i32`, `i64`)
- Comments: `//` and `/* */`

## Example Code

```blitz
fn main() -> i32 {
    return 42;
}
```

## License
